**Scenario**:
	You work for an educational tech company that developed an application to help teachers automatically grade assignments. The applications handles a wide range of data that it collects from academic institutions, instructors, parents and students.
	Your team was alerted to a data leak of internal business plans on social media. An investigation by the team discovered that an employee accidentally shared those confidential documents with an external business partner. An audit into the leak is underway to determine how similar incidents can be avoided.
	A supervisor provided you with information regarding the leak, and it appears that the principle of the least privilege was not observed by employees at the company during sales meeting. You have been asked to analyse the situation and find ways to prevent it from happening again.
	But first you need to evaluate details about the incident. Then, you'll review the controls in place to prevent data leaks. Next you'll identify ways to improve information privacy at the company. Finally, you'll justify why you think your recommendations will make data handling at the company more secure.
