**Scenario**:
	You've joined a new cybersecurity team at a commercial bank. The team is conducting a risk assessment of the bank's current operational environment. As part of the assessment, they are creating a risk register to help them focus on securing the most vulnerable risks.
	A **risk register** is a central record of potential risks to an organization's assets, information systems, and data. Security teams commonly use risk registers when conducting a risk assessment.
	Your supervisor asks you to evaluate a set of risks that the cybersecurity team has recorded in the risk register. For each risk, you will first determine how likely that risk is to occur. Then, you will determine how severely that risk may impact the bank. Finally, you will calculate a score for the severity of that risk. You will then compare scores across all risks so your team can determine how to prioritise their attention for each risk.

# Step 1 - Understand the environment
### Operational environment:
	  
The bank is located in a coastal area with low crime rates. Many people and systems handle the bank's dataâ€”100 on-premise employees and 20 remote employees. The customer base of the bank includes 2,000 individual accounts and 200 commercial accounts. The bank's services are marketed by a professional sports team and ten local businesses in the community. There are strict financial regulations that require the bank to secure their data and funds, like having enough cash available each day to meet Federal Reserve requirements.

# Step 2 - Analysing and categorising
	
Now we need to consider the information learned from the previous step to consider the likelihood and severity of the risks.
### Assets table

| **Asset** | **Risk(s)**               | **Description**                                                 | **Likelihood** | **Severity** | **Priority** |
| --------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Funds     | Business email compromise | _An employee is tricked into sharing confidential information._ | 2              | 3            | 6            |
|           | Compromised user database | _Customer data is poorly encrypted._                            | 1              | 3            | 3            |
|           | Financial records leak    | _A database server of backed up data is publicly accessible._   | 1              | 3            | 3            |
|           | Theft                     | _The bank's safe is left unlocked._                             | 3              | 1            | 3            |
|           | Supply chain disruption   | _Delivery delays due to natural disasters._                     | 1              | 1            | 1            |

# Step 3 - Putting altogether
	
Create an overview about the table inserting some examples of the risks that may happen:

	"Considering the risks pointed above, several security events may have negative impacts on the bank's funds. 
	A compromised email may lead to fraud or data leaks, the database corrupted along with the financial records leaks creates an doubtful and unreliable ambient for clients. 
	And the theft or attack on the supply chains may lead into the interruption of the banks operations, leading into financial loss."
