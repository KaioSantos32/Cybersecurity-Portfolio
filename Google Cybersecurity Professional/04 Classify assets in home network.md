**Overview**: Asset management and classification is an important part of an organization security plans. Creating an effective asset management needs first an asset inventory or a catalogue of assets that needs to be protected, then it involves **classifying the assets** based on their **importance** level and **sensitivity** to risks.

**Scenario**: 

> "One of the most valuable assets in the world today is information. Most information is accessed over a network. There tend to be a variety of devices connected to a network and each is a potential entry point to other assets.
> An inventory of network devices can be a useful asset management tool. An inventory can highlight sensitive assets that require extra protection.
> You’re operating a small business from your home and must create an inventory of your network devices. This will help you determine which ones contain sensitive information that require extra protection.
> To do this, you will start by identifying three devices that have access to your home network. This might include devices such as:
> 
> - Desktop or laptop computers;
> - Smartphones;
> - Smart home devices;
> - Game consoles;
> - Storage devices or servers;
> - Video streaming devices;
>   
> Then, you’ll list important characteristics of each device such as its owner, location, and type. Finally, you will assign each device a level of sensitivity based on how important it is to protect."

## Identifying assets
	
Now we'll identify the assets and it's sensitivity using the following table:

| **Categories** | **Access desgination**    |
| -------------- | ------------------------- |
| Restricted     | Need-to-know              |
| Confidential   | Limited to specific users |
| Internal-only  | Users on-premises         |
| Public         | Anyone                    |
